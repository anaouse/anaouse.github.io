## websocket

websocket means that you must accept all data it give you

## add env variant in ubuntu

logic:

PATH is env variant like apath:bpath

append export PATH = newpath:$PATH to end of bashrc 

when bash open it execute export PATH=... to add newpath to PATH 

source bashrc to use bashrc again

command:

echo 'export PATH="/root/.duckdb/cli/1.3.1:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

## clash let website or exe use direct mode

Profiles->yourprofile,right click and edit->rules: ...->config what you want

- PROCESS-NAME,QQ.exe,DIRECT : let exe use direct network

- DOMAIN-SUFFIX,test.com,DIRECT : let website use direct network

go to connections to check how they connet

the config maybe do not work in global mode. use rules mode and make it all use one server make it looks like global mode. 


## brainstorm with AI

how many thread can a process create?->every thread in a process has its own stack->Max Threads ≈ Available Virtual Memory / Stack Size per Thread.->On a 64-bit system with 8GB of addressable memory and a 2MB stack size per thread:
8GB (8,192MB) / 2MB ≈ 4,096 threads (theoretical max).

x86->intel 8086 in 1978, 32-bit architecture which handle 32 bit data type

what's the difference between aync wait and use thread directy in cpp?->std::thread Creates an OS-level thread, each with its own stack, Represents a separate flow of execution managed by the OS scheduler, Best for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., heavy computations) or when explicit thread control is needed, Resource-heavy due to thread creation overhead and stack memory allocation.->Async/Await (C++20 Coroutines):
Uses C++ coroutines to enable asynchronous programming without necessarily creating new OS threads.
Tasks are managed by a runtime or executor, which may run on a single thread or a thread pool.
Best for I/O-bound tasks (e.g., file operations, network requests) where tasks can pause and resume without blocking a thread.
Lightweight, as coroutines share a single thread’s stack or use minimal memory for their state.

what's thread pool ? why use it?->a collection of pre-initialized threads instead of creating and destroying threads for each task->Worker Threads, Task Queue, Thread Manager

why there are more than one test.exe?->User Action: Running test.exe multiple times from the command line, shortcuts, or scripts.->Programmatic Creation: Using system calls in the program to spawn new processes (e.g., CreateProcess in C++).->These exe are processes

## use true value to judge

I write this to get output in reverse :

```
for(int i=nums.size(); i--; i>-1)
        cout << nums[i] << ' ';  
```

it i-- and i != 0 it is true and cout; i > -1 is meaningless.

easier to understand: 

```
for (int i = nums.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--)
        cout << nums[i] << ' ';
```

## brainstorm with AI

what's socket? and what's socket program?-IP,port and protocol to connect two program->socket program contains server and client two sides->server-side manage connection and data sending receiving->client-side handle error, connect to server send request and receive response


## enumerate

https://oi-wiki.org/basic/enumerate/

bucket->use value as index

leetcode 1534: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-triplets/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=enumeration

just enumerate it : 

i=1...arr.size()->j=i+1...arr.size()->k=j+1...arr.size()->check every triplet

leetcode 1291:https://leetcode.com/problems/sequential-digits/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=enumeration

make the num

get the length of number->get start digit->check if the num is valid

example: 10-1000, min_len=2, max_len=4

length:2
        start digit:1...10-length=8(if start number is 9 digit after it can not be 10)
        12, 23, 34, 45, 56, 78, 89

length:3
        start digit:1...max_len-length
        ...

...

example:http://bailian.openjudge.cn/practice/2811/

make a martrix become all zero

rth line is determined by (r-1)th line, if (r-1)line c column is on, r line c column must be pressed to make it off.

so enumerate first line press situation is OK

powershell use Get-Content input.txt | .\test.exe to input data to exe

use std::cout << press[r][c] << (c == COLS - 1 ? "" : " ");  to cout matrix

1 << x means shifting 1 left x bits(1 << 3 => 1->100) to calculate 2^x

if((i>>c) & 1) to check if (c+1)th bit of i == 1

i=13, c=2 i>>c->1101->0011, 0011 & 0001 = 0001 check if the (2+1)th bits 1(1)01 is 1.

## timer project

two timers hotkey and  tray send all of messages

**initial**

hInstance is a handle to your application instance (your running .exe file).

Your Application (hInstance)

    └── Window Class (WNDCLASS) - "How windows should behave"
        ├── Window Instance 1 (HWND)
        ├── Window Instance 2 (HWND)
        └── Window Instance 3 (HWND)

register tray window, use callback function to process message,send create message->add tray icon->use hwnd connect to the window of main process and set its message type when interact with tray it will send message->register hotkey

**message**

GUI use message to handle interaction

get message(WM_QUIT will returns false, others return true)

translate:User presses Shift+A:
- GetMessage retrieves: WM_KEYDOWN (VK_SHIFT)
- GetMessage retrieves: WM_KEYDOWN (VK_A)
- TranslateMessage generates: WM_CHAR ('A')

DispatchMessage() calls WindowProc

**wm_hotkey**

alt+` -> send WM_HOTKEY-> MySetTimer

**wm_trayicon**

ShowContextMenu(hwnd);

**ShowContextMenu**

WM_COMMAND->ID_TRAY_EXIT or (ID_TRAY_TIMER->MySetTimer)

**mysettimer**

User presses Ctrl+Alt+T → WM_HOTKEY → ShowInputDialog() called

                                          ↓

                          Dialog created → WM_INITDIALOG → Dialog appears centered

                                          ↓

                          User types number and presses Enter → WM_COMMAND (IDOK)

                                          ↓

                          GetDlgItemText() reads the input → EndDialog() with the number

                                          ↓

                          DialogBoxParam() returns the number → Timer starts in main code

Windows manages the dialog window and assigns it a handle (hDlg)
Your lambda is just a callback function that Windows calls when events happen
You don't create or manage hDlg - Windows does that automatically
All messages come from Windows, not from your application code

initial and get text->use ID to kill existing main timer and tooltip timer->

set main timer to pop-up window when fires and a tooltip timer update tooltip timer :
        if (!SetTimer(hwnd, ID_MAIN_TIMER, minutes * 60 * 1000, NULL))  if (!SetTimer(hwnd, ID_TOOLTIP_TIMER, 1000, NULL))

**WM_TIMER**

use id to identify defferent timer

ID_MAIN_TIMER->kill timer and pop window and restore original

ID_TOOLTIP_TIMER->update how much time is left->updatetooltip()

## translation project

win32 predefine WM_XXX - WM_USER 0-1024

IDOK = 1, IDCANCEL = 2 ... so #define ID_TRAY_EXIT 1001

register class->create tray window->register hotkey, add trayicon

wm_hotkey->use input to simulate double click and ctrl+c->use lock to get and clipboard pointer to read and write->httpget from wininet->parse json(windows use utf16 encoding for gui, non-gui part use utf8-string)->render it

render window->create a window and use timer 1 to show and timer 2 to fade it->SHOW send paint message and use timer2 calls SetLayeredWindowAttributes(currentPopup , 0, 255, LWA_ALPHA)(make a window how transparent with the window behind the window) to fade it

class + callback function + message system
